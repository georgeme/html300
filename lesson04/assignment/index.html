<!-- Adding the details for my inspirations -->

    <h4>My inspirations: </h4>
      <p>For my animated header: https://www.royalnissan.com/</p>
      <p>I love the rotating hero/slide at the top of the page (full disclosure this is a site from my company). It's a huge product for us and very complex but I loved the idea of the rotation. I obviously wasn't able to do that type of animation but I was able to get rotating images. I learned about the way to transition the "figcaption" later in the assignment when I realized I had used animation and not "transition" per the assingment requirements so I didn't have time to add text to my header in the same way I have it for the navigation items. I may change that later so I can have the figcaptions the way I have them on smaller mobile devices (opaque, on the images) but we'll see. I didn't paste code here because I actually made a rotating header (very much simplified of course) for my site.</p>

      <p>For my navigation: SAA + my own idea</p>
      <p>We have the ability to use images as links (the hero slides can be as well as any other images the client chooses to make this way). I always think that's a cool, clean way to get you to another page. Then I thought, wouldn't it be cool to use that for the navigation but realized the images I wanted to use (while I think they're cool) don't really convey where you're going on the site so I realized I would need text as well. Since movies are totally visual, and in keeping with that "picture visual idea" I didn't want to add text to the site by default so decided to add it as a hover on the desktop site. That's not really practical for mobile but again, I didn't want to lose the theme so I used the "hover" effect as the mobile text but removed the transition.</p>

      <p>For my mixins: discussion from Office Hours 7/28</p>
      <p>When I asked about this during OH, Bryce showed an example of the font size mixin. I thought about that and realized that you can use mixins to replace/style any element you will style the same way repeatedly. I then looked at my css and found the areas that I used the same styling for continuously such as opacity, position, etc. That was how I came up with my mixins.</p>
